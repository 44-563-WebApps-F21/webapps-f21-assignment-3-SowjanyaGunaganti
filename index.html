        The Catalan number Cn is the solution for

Number of correct bracket sequence consisting of n opening and n closing brackets.
The number of rooted full binary trees with n+1 leaves (vertices are not numbered). A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children.
The number of ways to completely parenthesize n+1 factors.
The number of triangulations of a convex polygon with n+2 sides (i.e. the number of partitions of polygon into disjoint triangles by using the diagonals).
The number of ways to connect the 2n points on a circle to form n disjoint chords.
The number of non-isomorphic full binary trees with n internal nodes (i.e. nodes having at least one son).
The number of monotonic lattice paths from point (0,0) to point (n,n) in a square lattice of size n×n, which do not pass above the main diagonal (i.e. connecting (0,0) to (n,n)).
Number of permutations of length n that can be stack sorted (i.e. it can be shown that the rearrangement is stack sorted if and only if there is no such index i<j<k, such that ak<ai<aj ).
The number of non-crossing partitions of a set of n elements.
The number of ways to cover the ladder 1…n using n rectangles (The ladder consists of n columns, where ith column has a height i).
